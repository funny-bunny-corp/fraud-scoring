  title: Fraud Detection API
  version: '1.0.0'
  description: |
    This API is responsible for handling real-time fraud detection events within our financial system. 
    It provides operations for subscribing to transaction scores, publishing fraud alerts, and managing 
    transaction processing events. The API uses Apache Kafka for event streaming and follows the 
    CloudEvents specification for standardized event messaging.

    ## Key Features
    - Real-time fraud detection scoring
    - Transaction processing events
    - Fraud alert notifications
    - User behavior analytics
    - Historical transaction analysis

    ## Event Flow
    1. Transaction events are published to the payment processing channel
    2. Fraud scoring service processes transactions and generates scorecards
    3. Scorecards are published to the fraud detection channel
    4. High-risk transactions trigger fraud alerts
    5. All events are logged for audit and analytics

  fraud-detection.transaction-scorecard:
    description: |
      This channel is dedicated to receiving messages containing transaction scorecard data, 
      which are crucial for our fraud detection processes. Scorecards include multiple risk 
      factors such as value analysis, seller reputation, historical patterns, and currency stability.

      summary: Subscribe to Transaction ScoreCard Events
      description: |
        Allows the subscriber to receive real-time scorecard data related to financial transactions. 
        This data includes scores from different perspectives, like value, seller reliability, 
        average value, and currency stability, which collectively aid in the process of fraud detection.
        
        Events are partitioned by user document to ensure ordered processing per user.
