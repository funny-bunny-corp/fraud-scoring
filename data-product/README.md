## Data Quality & SLA

### Data Freshness
- **Target Latency**: < 5 seconds from transaction processing to availability
- **Maximum Latency**: < 30 seconds (99.9% percentile)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time lag monitoring via Kafka consumer lag metrics

### Data Completeness
- **Required Fields**: All schema fields marked as `notNull: true` are guaranteed
- **Missing Data**: < 0.1% of events may have optional fields missing
- **Validation**: Pre-ingestion validation ensures data integrity

### Data Accuracy
- **Scoring Accuracy**: Risk scores validated against historical fraud outcomes
- **Data Lineage**: Full traceability from source transaction to scorecard
- **Audit Trail**: CloudEvents metadata provides complete event provenance

### Retention Policy
- **Hot Data**: 90 days (immediate query access)
- **Cold Storage**: 7 years (compliance requirements)
- **Archival**: Automatic migration to long-term storage

## Usage Guidelines

### Intended Consumers
- **Fraud Analysts**: Real-time transaction monitoring and investigation
- **Data Scientists**: Model development and validation

## Example Queries

### 1. Real-time High-Risk Transaction Monitoring
```sql
SELECT 
    transaction_id,
    buyer_document,
